### What I learned

This was quite a long project that took me about a month to complete. Unfortunately, due to holidays and my workload, I couldn't dedicate as much time as I wanted, but I'm happy to have finished it in the end. The HTML and CSS parts were fairly straightforward. In JavaScript, I spent the most time on the lightbox. Initially, I wanted to use the same lightbox element for the mobile view, but when I couldn't make it work, I ended up planning it as a separate element.

Additionally, instead of creating a product with only static text, I structured it as an array to make it appear as if the product data came from an API. I defined all the information there, which allowed me to reuse and modify the same variables across multiple places.

As for features outside the original project plans, I developed a system where items are dynamically added and removed instead of just using a standalone trash bin. (I noticed this approach is common in many e-commerce sites.) Also, items added to the shopping cart disappear after a certain period but reappear when you hover over the cart icon.

Initially, I planned to add a dark mode as well, but I decided to skip it because I wanted to finish the project. Maybe I'll implement it in my next project.
